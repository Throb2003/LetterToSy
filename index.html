      <h1>Dear Sy,</h1>
      <p>I have been meaning to put some thoughts into words,thoughts that have crossing quietly in my mind even as we laughed, shared stories, and spent more time together lately</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s been really good reconnecting with you. I have missed that part of usâ€”the ease, the fun we had together, closure, love we had for each. But Iâ€™d be lying if I say we were always happy. We argued, we stopped talking, we even hurt each other in ways that even us didn't know. all this was because we had our own problems and  yeah the mistrust and all the other things that came across while we were at it. I care deeply about you, and being around you again has stirred that hope I carry for something more.</p>
      <p>I just want to be honest with you. I can see that you might still feel something for me in your own ways, and that means a lotâ€”but Iâ€™ve also heard you say that youâ€™re uncertain and with the usual words"IDK & lEMME THINK ABT IT". And I respect that. I know clarity doesnâ€™t always come easy, especially when thereâ€™s history involved.</p>
      <p>All I ask is that we are honest with each otherâ€”as friends, as people whoâ€™ve shared something meaningful. Iâ€™m here, not just hoping for something to happen, but trusting that whatever does will be genuine. Whether we find our way back or take different paths, I want you to know that I value you, and I value what we had.</p>
      <p>So wherever your heart leads, Iâ€™ll walk my path with respect for yours.</p>
      <p class="signature">With care,<br>Evans</p>
